# Introduction

Sharkur is a fork of [Purpur](https://github.com/PurpurMC/Purpur) which adds more configuration and also some optimization. Everything you need can be found in this documentation.

Sharkur is a drop in replacement for [Purpur](https://purpurmc.org) ([Paper](https://papermc.io)), so if you don't know how to install the server see [Getting Started](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/getting-started). The only thing you change is jar file (paper), which you can download [here](/missingdownloads)
